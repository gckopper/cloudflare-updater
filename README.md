Bot to dynamicly change dns for AAAA records (IPv6) on cloudflare when internet connection is reconnected.

# Requeriments
* Domain in cloudflare
* Root privileges

# Use case
* Your server does not have fixed IPv6 prefix
* You want your NGINX server to only be exposed in one IPv6 interface with no fixed ip
* You want to help me improve my Go skills haha
